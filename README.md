HandiCraft Hub – Supporting Local Artisans.


HandiCraft Hub is a web-based platform designed to help local handicraft artisans showcase and promote their handmade products online. Many small artisans face difficulties reaching customers due to limited digital knowledge, and this project aims to bridge that gap. By providing a simple and visually appealing website, we empower artisans to present their skills, creativity, and products to a wider audience.

The platform highlights a variety of traditional and handmade items including shawls, pottery, bags, wooden crafts, metal artwork, and decorative pieces. Each product is represented with clear and high-quality images to help customers appreciate the details and craftsmanship behind every item. The website’s layout is intentionally kept clean, minimalistic, and product-focused to ensure smooth navigation.

Built entirely using HTML and CSS, the website is lightweight and loads quickly on all devices. Its responsive design ensures that users can browse comfortably on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. The project demonstrates how basic web technologies can be used to create meaningful digital solutions for real-world needs.

One of the key objectives of HandiCraft Hub is to promote traditional art forms and celebrate the hard work of artisans who preserve cultural heritage. Through this platform, buyers can explore various categories, understand the uniqueness of handmade items, and support local talent by choosing handcrafted products.

This project was created as part of a group collaboration, combining efforts in design, development, and content organization. It reflects the importance of teamwork as well as the potential of technology in uplifting small businesses. The site can be expanded in the future with features like seller dashboards, product search, filters, cart functionality, authentication, and payment integration, making it a complete online marketplace.

Overall, HandiCraft Hub is not just a college project—it is a step toward encouraging people to support artisans and acknowledge the beauty of handmade craftsmanship.
