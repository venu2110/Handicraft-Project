HandiCraft Hub – Supporting Local Artisans
A platform designed to support local handicraft artisans by helping them showcase and sell their handmade products online.

HandiCraft Hub is a web-based platform created to help local handicraft artisans showcase and sell their handmade products online. Many small-scale artisans struggle to promote their products digitally, so this project provides them an easy and accessible way to reach a wider audience.
The website includes various categories like shawls, bags, pottery, wooden crafts, and traditional artwork, each displayed with high-quality images for better visibility.

Built using HTML and CSS, the platform offers a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface suitable for both sellers and buyers. The goal of this project is to preserve traditional art, promote cultural craftsmanship, and create new opportunities for local artisans.
Users can browse product categories, view detailed images, and explore different handicraft collections through a simple and attractive layout.

This project was developed as a group effort to support artisan communities and demonstrate how technology can empower small businesses. It can be further enhanced with features like seller login, cart system, or payment integration in future updates.
